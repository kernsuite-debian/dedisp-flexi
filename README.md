# dedisp
This repositry is derived from Ben Barsdell's original GPU De-dedispersion library (code.google.com/p/dedisp) via Andrew Jamesons Git repo. The only differences are that this version has no GPU architecture dependence.

Installation Instructions:

  1.  git clone https://github.com/ewanbarr/dedisp-flexi.git
  2.  make && make install
  
  This will build a shared object library named libdedisp.so which is a prerequisite for Heimdall
